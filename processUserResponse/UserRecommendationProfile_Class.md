## JSON Object Definition

For now, it may be simplest to define this "class" as just a JSON object, without class declaration.

```
userRecProfile = {
	user_id: 23,
	date: 1539543705234, //standard for JS Date.now(). Use JS to convert to readable strings.
	keyWordList: ['shoes', 'Nike', 'Phil', 'Knight']
}
```
